# ArcaneSpaceAI

**ArcaneSpaceAI** is a smart 3D design platform that blends magic with optimization. With real-time editing using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), AI-guided design suggestions, and genetic algorithms, it lets you craft dynamic landscapes, characters, and objects with ease.

## Features

- **Real-Time 3D Editing:** Design and manipulate 3D models directly in your browser.
- **AI-Guided Suggestions:** Receive smart recommendations to enhance your designs.
- **Genetic Algorithms:** Optimize shapes and structures using evolutionary computation.
- **Collaborative Workspace:** Work with other creators in real time.
- **Export Options:** Save your creations in popular formats (GLTF, OBJ, STL).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlizaYInspiratioN2/ArcaneSpaceAI.git
    cd ArcaneSpaceAI
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    # For backend (if applicable)
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # For frontend (if applicable)
    npm install
    ```
3. **Run the project**
    ```bash
    # For backend
    python main.py

    # For frontend
    npm start
    ```

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – 3D rendering
- [Python](https://python.org/) / [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – Backend
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – Frontend
